__Description:__
_This is a modern service for real travelers. The service helps to plan a trip route in detail, calculate the cost of travel and get information about attractions. The minimalistic interface will not give you a reason to be distracted and will focus on planning your trip._

I used the MVP pattern in development of this training project.
I also learned how to create SPA using a custom framework and principles of object-oriented programming.
